    <h1>🎸 Day 01 – Band Name Generator</h1>
    <p>This quirky little program helps you generate a band name based on your hometown and your pet’s name. It’s a fun way to get started with Python input/output and string formatting!</p>

    <h2>💡 How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>User is greeted with a welcome message.</li>
      <li>They're asked which city they grew up in.</li>
      <li>They're asked for the name of their pet.</li>
      <li>The program combines the two to suggest a band name.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🧪 Try It Yourself</h2>
    <p><em>This demo is a static preview of the project’s logic.</em></p>
    <pre><code>
👋 Greetings, Stranger!
🌆 Which city did you grow up in? → Tokyo  
🐶 What is the name of your pet? → Neko  
🎤 Your band name could be: Tokyo Neko
    </code></pre>
